# Acceleration-of-RED-via-Vector-Extrapolation

Demonstration of the image restoration experiments conducted in T. Hong, Y. Romano, and M. Elad, "[Acceleration of RED via Vector Extrapolation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02158.pdf)". Find the details in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02158.pdf. In this paper, we propose one accelerated technique called Vector Extrapolation (RED) for RED. 

Note that this software is highly depend on the original RED code, see https://github.com/google/RED. So if you use this code, please also cite the original RED paper. [Y. Romano, M. Elad, and P. Milanfar, "The Little Engine that Could: Regularization by Denoising (RED)", SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences, 10(4), 1804–1844, 2017.]
